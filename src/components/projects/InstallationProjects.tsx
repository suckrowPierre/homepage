    shortDescription: "This project aims to provoke participants to reflect and possibly even relive a memory of theirs through audio stimuli. For this, we have developed an installation that tries to translate a provided memory into a personal soundscape through the use of Generative AI. The auditory experience is supplemented by immersion in an augmented space in the form of an artificial enclosure that shields the user from the outside environment. We experimented with shared and single experiences and also spatial exploration of virtual sound sources.\n",
