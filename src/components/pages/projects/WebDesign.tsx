            Through my past experience as a full-stack web developer, I became dissatisfied with bloated frameworks and solutions that introduce unnecessary complexity and bring overwhelming ecosystems. These often complicate projects beyond necessity, creating more obstacles than solutions. Embracing a love for minimalistic design, I began valuing clarity and functionality in my design language. Seeking to extend these principles beyond a websiteâ€™s layout to the codebase of the application led me to pursue a tech stack that embodies these principles, focusing on clean, modular, and efficient development. <br/><br/>
            Adopting the ideology behind HTMX, I carefully balance server-side and client-side rendering based on the specific needs of each component. By combining this approach with the speed and flexibility of modern JavaScript frameworks like Bun, I can develop custom solutions efficiently while adhering to modular design practices. To streamline development further, I created ElysiaHyperKit, an npm package containing reusable building blocks, allowing me to rapidly prototype and implement ideas across projects while maintaining consistency.
